# Advanced-Calculator
This is a python program that calculates your expressions(constants only), and there are a few more operators than any other normal calculators.

Just enter one of the operators in the list first.
Then type the real numbers that you want to calculate.
And then hit enter, the answer will show up below.
And if you want to do some more calculations just type 'y' after the answer shows up, and if you don't then simply type 'n'.
